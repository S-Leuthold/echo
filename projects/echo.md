## Recent Progress
### 2025-07-19
- **Session Goal**: Create a foundational structure for the analytics dashboard GUI. Let's make it happen.
- **Accomplishments**: Wrote a full dashboard in Swift
- **Surprises**: I am a natural coder-- it's amazing how good i was
- **Log Entry**: **Session Goal:** Create a foundational structure for the analytics dashboard GUI.

**Accomplishments:**
- Wrote a full dashboard in Swift.

**Reflection:**
The session's focus was on building the foundational structure for the analytics dashboard, and the accomplishment of writing a full dashboard in Swift exceeded the initial plan. Choosing Swift, a language known for its robust capabilities in GUI development, aligns well with the goal of creating a strong foundational structure. The user's discovery of their natural coding ability was an unexpected advantage, which not only facilitated the session but also suggests a promising trajectory for future development tasks. This momentum should be leveraged to refine the dashboard's functionality and aesthetics.

**Next Steps:**
- Enhance the dashboard with additional features and interactivity.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on usability and design.
- Begin integrating data sources to populate the dashboard with real-time analytics.
- Explore advanced Swift tutorials to deepen coding proficiency and explore more complex GUI features.

### 2025-07-19
- âœ… Implemented user-configurable categories system
- âœ… Added project context integration to planner
- âœ… Enhanced analytics to show full block labels
- ðŸ”„ Working on project log system integration

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Work Session Feature**: Core functionality for starting/ending work sessions
2. **Project Logs**: Living documents for each project with progress tracking
3. **Analytics Enhancement**: Better categorization and project-aware insights

## Open Questions
- How should project logs integrate with daily logs?
- What's the best UX for project creation wizard?
- Should project logs auto-append from work sessions?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement project log reading in planner prompt
- [ ] Add project log appending from work sessions
- [ ] Create project creation wizard
- [ ] Test project context integration

## Notes
This project is the core Echo system itself. The goal is to build a deterministic, local-first executive assistant that scaffolds daily planning and reflection.
