**Reviewing task list**

The user wants me to review a task list with high specificity, focusing on identifying gaps or missing tasks, estimating the duration of each task, and providing a brief description. I'll also need to highlight what each task unlocks and note any potential dependencies or blockers. While I'm thinking the format could be a table, I'll avoid overusing it based on prior guidance but might still consider it if summarizing multiple tasks clearly. Let's break down each task in terms of these elements.

**Identifying gaps in the task list**

The task list seems to be missing some key items, like a unit test framework, secrets management, and build distribution. I also see there's no logging system or onboarding process explicitly listed. Additionally, it looks like we need to address security concerns and add some notification channel integrations.

I'll be breaking down the list into smaller tasks, estimating the time for each one in terms of duration, and clarifying what each task unlocks or depends on. Let's refine this!

**Breaking down tasks**

The tasks my user provided seem extensive, covering everything from rule engines to mobile interfaces, and even project tracking. I’ll need a table summarizing these tasks with descriptions, estimates, unlocking elements, and blockers. This will help in breaking down each

Thought for 21 seconds

Below is a **task-by-task implementation matrix** that expands the high-level workstreams into granular steps, flags missing pieces, and spells out duration, purpose, unlocks, and blockers. Tasks are grouped by workstream but listed individually so you can slot them straight into a project board.

### 🕳️ Potential Gaps Identified

| Gap                                       | Impact if Ignored                     | Suggestion                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automated testing + CI pipeline**       | Silent regressions when refactoring.  | Add Pytest suite + GitHub Actions early.                        |
| **Secrets management** (Notion, Calendar) | Token leaks / brittle dev setup.      | `.env` + wrapper util; document in README.                      |
| **Error telemetry / debug logging**       | Hard to repro field bugs.             | Structured logger with rotating files.                          |
| **Installer / packaging**                 | Friction for mobile & fresh installs. | Use `pipx` or Homebrew formula post-MVP.                        |
| **Daemonization / background process**    | Notifications won’t fire reliably.    | Decide: launchd (macOS), systemd (Linux), Task Scheduler (Win). |
| **Cross-time-zone logic**                 | Travel profile could break anchors.   | Store all times in local TZ; add TZ param in config.            |
| **Security review for Notion writes**     | Accidental overwrite of data.         | Dry-run flag & explicit database mapping.                       |
| **Documentation site**                    | Future contributors lose context.     | Use MkDocs; publish vision, PRD, API refs.                      |

### 🔑 How to Read “Unlocks” vs. “Blockers”

* **Unlocks** = the first downstream task or capability that becomes feasible once this task is complete.
* **Blockers** = tasks, approvals, or resources that must exist first; tackle these early to avoid idle time.

---

With these estimates and gap flags you can now:

1. **Prioritize** short-blocker tasks (e.g., secrets, validation) that unlock large surfaces.
2. **Parallelize** non-blocking streams (e.g., Template writing, Markdown schema) to different days or contributors.
3. **Schedule** stretch items (UI, momentum reports) after the core loop (Tasks 1-24) is stable—matching the MVP focus in the PRD.

Let me know which slice you’d like to tackle first, and I can produce a day-level Gantt or detailed acceptance criteria for that set.
