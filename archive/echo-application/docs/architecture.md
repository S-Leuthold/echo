# Echo Application Architecture

## Feature-Based Structure
- All features are organized under `src/features/` (e.g., `sidebar`, `today`).
- Shared UI primitives live in `src/components/ui/` (generated by shadcn/ui).
- Global state stores are in `src/store/`.

## Design System
- Custom color palette defined in `globals.css` and mapped to Tailwind utility classes.
- All components use semantic color names for maintainability and themeability.

## Layout
- Root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) applies the Inter font, theme, and includes the Sidebar.
- Pages are organized by route under `src/app/`.

## State Management
- **Server state:** Managed by SWR (data fetching, caching).
- **Client state:** Managed by Zustand (UI state, global stores).

## Component Ownership
- All UI primitives are generated and owned in the codebase via shadcn/ui for full customizability.
