    "energy_optimization": "Starting with high-energy tasks during 6-9am window when cognitive function peaks. Scheduling creative or strategic work for mid-morning (9-11am) when energy remains strong. Afternoon blocks (1-4pm) reserved for collaborative or administrative tasks that require less intense focus. Evening wind-down with planning and reflection.",

    "recovery_planning": "Built-in 15-30 minute breaks between major work blocks to prevent burnout. Longer lunch break (12-1pm) for physical and mental reset. Evening buffer (8-10pm) allows for flexible wind-down without forcing productivity when energy naturally declines."

  "narrative": {
    "summary": "I've crafted your schedule around your solid energy level of 7, front-loading your most important work into the morning hours when you'll be sharpest. Since you have no fixed commitments today, I've created focused 90-minute blocks that align with your natural energy rhythms - starting with deep work on the echo project when your mind is freshest. I've also built in strategic breaks between sessions to help you maintain this energy throughout the day, with a gradual transition to lighter tasks in the afternoon. The evening includes time for planning tomorrow, ensuring you stay ahead without burning out.",
