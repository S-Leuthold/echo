You have a substantial dataset of 100k customer records with rich features including usage patterns, payment history, support interactions, subscription tiers, and demographics. The goal is to identify at-risk customers proactively so your team can implement retention strategies through targeted outreach and offers.\n\nOn the technical side, you're planning to use Python with scikit-learn for baseline models and gradient boosting frameworks (XGBoost/LightGBM) for production performance. The model will be deployed as an API service that integrates with your CRM system for real-time predictions.\n\nDid I capture everything correctly?
