  "narrative": {
    "summary": "I've structured your day to maximize that solid energy level of 7 while respecting your late start and early departure. Given that finishing the Geoderma Review is your top priority, I've front-loaded the response to Katie and the MAOM-N edits in your morning peak hours - you'll knock out Katie's response first thing to clear that mental tab, then dive into the substantive editing work while your focus is sharpest. The AI-LEAF meeting actually works well as a natural break before your deep writing session on the Ensemble Methods. I've placed the echo analytics work and Margenot email draft in the early afternoon when your energy might naturally dip a bit - these tasks require focus but perhaps less creative heavy lifting than the morning's writing work. The horizons setup is perfectly positioned at the end of your workday so you can get it running as soon as you get home. This schedule respects your need to catch up after a slow week while not overextending yourself before tomorrow's heavier day.",
