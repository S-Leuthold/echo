I prioritized Echo development in the early morning when your energy is fresh - giving you a solid 3.5-hour block for database work before golf. After golf, I've sequenced your household tasks strategically: cleaning first (ensuring it's done well before Hunter arrives), then grocery shopping, and finally meal planning at home.
