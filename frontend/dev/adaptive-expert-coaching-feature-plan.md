# Adaptive Expert Coaching Feature Plan
**Transforming Project Creation from Data Entry to Strategic Consultation**

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This feature transforms Echo's project creation wizard from a passive form-filler into an intelligent, domain-specific project management consultant. By implementing adaptive conversation flow with automatic expert persona switching, we create a "thinking partner" experience that guides users through strategic project planning while building their project management capabilities.

**Core Innovation**: The AI naturally discovers project context through conversation, then automatically transforms into a domain expert (Academic Writing Coach, Technical Architect, Creative Mentor, etc.) to provide specialized guidance based on proven methodologies.

---

## üß† **Research-Based Prompting Strategy**

Based on 2025 LLM best practices research, our prompting architecture leverages:

### **CO-STAR Framework Implementation**
- **Context**: Domain-specific background and project understanding
- **Objective**: Clear coaching goals aligned with project success
- **Style**: Expert consultant tone with supportive guidance
- **Tone**: Professional but encouraging, methodology-driven
- **Audience**: Tailored to user expertise level (beginner/intermediate/expert)
- **Response**: Structured strategic guidance with actionable next steps

### **Multi-Turn Conversation Design**
Following Claude API best practices for conversational applications:
- **Message History Management**: Maintains context across persona switches
- **System Prompt Evolution**: Dynamic prompt updating based on conversation stage
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Explicit step-by-step strategic thinking
- **Context Window Optimization**: Efficient use of conversation history

### **Structured Prompt Architecture**
```
System Role Definition + Domain Expertise + Methodology Framework + Conversation Stage + User Context + Output Format
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **Three-Phase Conversation Flow**

```
Phase 1: Discovery Agent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Natural conversation and context building
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Intelligent questioning to understand project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Project type and domain detection

Phase 2: Confirmation & Classification  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Summary of understanding for user validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Automatic domain detection and persona selection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Transparent transition to expert mode

Phase 3: Expert Coaching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain-specific strategic guidance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Methodology-based recommendations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Risk assessment and success planning
```

### **Domain Detection Engine**

**Approach**: Semantic analysis of conversation content rather than rigid keyword matching.

```python
class DomainDetector:
    def analyze_conversation(self, conversation_history, project_summary):
        # Multi-layered analysis
        indicators = {
            "explicit_terms": self.extract_direct_indicators(text),
            "contextual_patterns": self.analyze_goal_patterns(text), 
            "methodology_signals": self.detect_process_references(text),
            "deliverable_types": self.classify_outcomes(text)
        }
        
        confidence_scores = self.calculate_domain_confidence(indicators)
        return self.select_optimal_persona(confidence_scores)
```

**Detection Categories**:
- **Academic Writing**: Research, publications, peer review, methodology
- **Software Development**: Applications, features, users, technical architecture  
- **Creative Projects**: Stories, artistic expression, creative process
- **Business Strategy**: Market goals, revenue, operations, stakeholders
- **Learning & Development**: Skills, curriculum, knowledge transfer
- **Event & Campaign**: Coordination, promotion, audience engagement
