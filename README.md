## **Phase 3: Advanced Integrations** üöß
- [ ] macOS app with notifications
- [ ] Mobile companion app
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Integration with external tools 

## Outlook Email Integration (Microsoft Graph API)

Echo now supports secure, modern email integration using Microsoft Graph API and OAuth 2.0.

### Setup
1. Register an app in the Azure Portal and obtain your Application (client) ID and client secret.
2. Set your redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`.
3. In your `.env` file, add:
   ```
   ECHO_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
   ECHO_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
   ECHO_GRAPH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/auth/callback
   ```
4. Run the OAuth login flow:
   ```bash
   python -m echo.cli oauth_login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate and save your token.

### Usage
- To fetch and display a summary of your recent emails:
  ```bash
  python -m echo.cli email_summary
  ```
- The summary will show the subject, sender, and received time for your most recent emails.

### Integration with Daily Planning
- Email summaries can be included in your daily planning and reflection workflows.
- You can extend the CLI or planning scripts to automatically fetch and summarize emails as part of your morning or evening routines.
- Action items and urgent emails can be surfaced for prioritization in your daily plan.

### **Configuration:**
```yaml
# config/user_config.yaml
email:
  outlook_access_token: ""  # Will be added via OAuth
  important_senders:
    - "ceo@company.com"
    - "manager@company.com"
    - "client@company.com"
  urgent_keywords:
    - "urgent"
    - "asap"
    - "deadline"
    - "important"
  action_keywords:
    - "please"
    - "can you"
    - "need"
    - "review"
    - "send"
    - "schedule"
```

### **Example Usage:**
```bash
# Get daily email summary
echo email_summary

# View pending action items
echo email_actions

# Check urgent items only
echo email_urgent

# Process new emails and extract actions
echo email_process
```

### **Sample Output:**
```
üìä **Email Summary for Monday, January 20**
==================================================
üìß Total Emails: 15
üö® Urgent: 3
‚úÖ Action Items: 7
