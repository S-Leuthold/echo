#  Notes and Ideas

- Automatically reading email from a folder and integrating that context into the spin down of the day. 

- Having a check on the formatting of the intitial LLM output that sends it back if rules are violated. Like, every minute must be accounted for, must match format, etc.

- Stats block -- how many hours of deep work, how many hours cooking, etc.
