  "narrative": {
    "summary": "I've structured your day to maximize that solid energy level of 7 while respecting your late start and early departure. Given that finishing the Geoderma Review is your top priority, I've placed it right at the beginning of your workday (8:30-10:00) when you'll be freshest after the Paige meeting. This gives you 90 focused minutes to complete and send it before the AI-LEAF call. After the meeting, you'll have good momentum to tackle the MAOM-N edits - I've allocated the full 90 minutes you requested from 11:00-12:30. The Ensemble methods writing fits perfectly in your early afternoon slot (12:45-2:45) when you'll still have sustained focus for creative work. I've distributed the remaining tasks strategically through the afternoon: Katie's quick response right after lunch, the echo backend work when you might appreciate something more technical and less writing-intensive, and Andrew's email draft as your final task before leaving. This sequencing respects both your energy patterns and the 4:15 departure time. Once home around 6:15, you can immediately start the horizons run to ensure it completes overnight, then focus on dinner prep for that 7:30 target. The evening stays relaxed as you wanted - just cooking and unwinding after a productive catch-up day.",
